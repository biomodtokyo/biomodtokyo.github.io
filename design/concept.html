    <h2>The Vehicle: A DNA Hydrogel Body</h2>
    <p>The physical structure of our nanorobot is a hydrogel, which acts as its "body" or "vehicle." This gel is meticulously assembled from two primary DNA components that form a dynamic, three-dimensional network.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cross-shaped DNA:</strong> These rigid, cross-shaped nanostructures serve as the fundamental building blocks, forming the stable framework of the hydrogel.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridge DNA:</strong> These flexible DNA strands act as linkers, connecting the cross-shaped units. The state of these bridges dictates the overall shape and size of the hydrogel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By controlling the interactions within this network, we can induce macroscopic changes in the hydrogel's form, such as expansion and contraction.</p>

    <h2>The 'Brain': An Autonomous DNA Toolbox</h2>
    <p>The robot's movement is driven by an internal "brain," which is a sophisticated DNA reaction circuit. This circuit functions as a molecular oscillator, generating signals autonomously without any external input. This control system is designed with the following key elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DNA Oscillator Circuit:</strong> At the core of the brain is a chemical oscillator that periodically changes the concentration of two key molecules, which we designate as <strong>α</strong> and <strong>β</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Trigger Molecules (Expander & Shrinker):</strong> The oscillator's outputs are translated into physical action by two types of trigger DNA strands:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expander Strand:</strong> Generated when the concentration of molecule α is high. This strand interacts with the Bridge DNA to cause the hydrogel to swell or expand.</li>
          <li><strong>Shrinker Strand:</strong> Generated when the concentration of molecule β is high. This strand reverses the action of the expander, causing the hydrogel to contract.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrated Function: Autonomous Locomotion</h2>
    <p>The true innovation lies in the integration of the "body" and "brain." The DNA oscillator continuously and cyclically produces the expander and shrinker strands. These strands, in turn, interact with the hydrogel network, forcing it to expand and contract periodically. This sequence creates a rhythmic, self-sustained motion, allowing our DNA nanorobot to achieve autonomous locomotion. The entire process is pre-programmed into the DNA sequences, making the system self-contained and independent.</p>
