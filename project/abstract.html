            <h3>Background: The Navigational Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                One of the greatest challenges in modern drug therapy is the “navigational challenge” of how to accurately deliver drugs to the affected area. Conventional drugs spread throughout the entire body, affecting healthy tissues and causing serious side effects. This is due to two fundamental problems: the low target accumulation of drugs and the narrow therapeutic window, where the difference between the effective dose and the toxic dose is small. To overcome this situation, we propose a new paradigm in which drugs autonomously determine their destination and act only there.

            <h3>Methods: A Hydrogel Controlled by a DNA Toolbox</h3>
            <p>
                Our solution to this challenge is a smart drug delivery system (DDS) constructed entirely from DNA. This system consists of two main components. One is a DNA hydrogel that acts as a “vehicle” to encapsulate the drug. The other is a “brain” in the form of a DNA toolbox, which is the key to autonomous operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DNA toolbox, acting as the “brain,” is an oscillator that autonomously generates periodic signals (α and β) like a biological clock. These signals control the hydrogel “vehicle” via an amplification system that acts as a “glue” we designed. Signal α generates “extension strands” that expand the gel, while signal β generates “contraction strands” that shrink the gel. This mechanism enables the DNA toolbox to periodically expand and contract the DNA hydrogel.

            <h3>Designed & Expected Results</h3>
            <p>
                The project is currently in the process of revising the method for producing DNA hydrogel, exploring more efficient ways to solve differential equations in simulated DNA logic circuits, and creating an objective function and learning mechanism to find the optimal oscillation in the simulation.

            <h3>Conclusion & Vision</h3>
            <p>
                Our research establishes a highly versatile and programmable platform for creating dynamic DNA-based materials. The “programmability” of this system, where the dynamic behavior of the gel can be freely changed simply by replacing the oscillator module with another module in the toolbox, is a major advantage. We believe this research will open a new chapter in smart therapeutics and eventually lead to the development of fully autonomous nanorobots.
